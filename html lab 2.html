<p>In one of its longest missions, the <i>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</i> successfully placed nine satellites, including an <i>Earth Observation Satellite (EOS-06)</i> in multiple orbits with the help of the space agency’s <i>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C54)</i>. The vehicle took off precisely at 11.56 a.m. on Saturday from the <i>first launch pad (FLP)</i> at the <i>Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC)</i>, SHAR.</p>

<p>The eight nano satellites include ISRO Nano Satellite-2 for Bhutan (INS-2B), Anand, Astrocast (four satellites), and two Thybolt satellites. Notably, EOS-6 is the Oceansat series’ third-generation satellite. This is the 56th flight of the <i>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)</i> and the 24th flight of the PSLV-XL version with 6 PSOM-Xls.e Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on November 26, 2022.</p>

<p>The eight nano satellites include ISRO Nano Satellite-2 for Bhutan (INS-2B), Anand, Astrocast (four satellites), and two Thybolt satellites. Notably, EOS-6 is the Oceansat series’ third-generation satellite. This is the 56th flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the 24th flight of the PSLV-XL version with 6 PSOM-Xls.EOS-06 is envisaged to observe ocean colour data, sea surface temperature and wind vector data to use in oceanography, climatic and meteorological applications. The satellite also supports value added products such as potential fishing zone using chlorophyll, SST and wind speed, and land based geophysical parameters.</p>
<p>ISRO Chairman S.Somanath said that the mission is accomplished and all the satellites have been injected into their intended orbits. <b>“For us, the India-Bhutan satellite is a very important milestone in the history of joint collaboration of Indian scientist and Bhutanese scientists in building this satellite with two payloads.” </b>External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, said, <b>“Today we have achieved a historic milestone in India’s bi-lateral co-operation with Bhutan. As two special friends and neighbours, in a span of two years, the collaborative effort of a dedicated team of space engineers and scientists from ISRO and Bhutanese side have culminated today in the launch of this satellite.” </b>He added that ISRO is also working with Bhutan in establishing a ground station in Thimphu, which will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>The Primary satellite (EOS-06) was separated in Orbit-1. Subsequently, orbit was changed by using two Orbit Change Thrusters (OCTs) introduced in the Propulsion Bay Ring of the PSLV-C54 Vehicle. Later, all the seven commercial satellites from NSIL were deployed successfully. Astrocast, a 3U spacecraft with 4 Satellites from Spaceflight Inc, U.S., were separated.

Following this, the Thybolt, a 0.5U spacecraft bus that includes a communication payload to enable rapid technology demonstration and constellation development for multiple users from Dhruva Space using their own Orbital Deployer with a minimum lifetime of one year, was deployed in the intended orbit. The Anand three axis stabilised nano satellite, a technology demonstrator for miniaturised electro-optical payload and all other sub-systems like TTC, power, onboard computer and ADCS from Pixxel, India was also placed in the orbit.</p>

<p>Further, the India-Bhutan Sat was successfully deployed. A collaborative mission between India and Bhutan, the INS-2B satellite has two payloads namely NanoMx, a multispectral optical imaging payload developed by Space Applications Centre (SAC) and APRS-Digipeater, which is jointly developed by DITT-Bhutan and URSC.

<h2><u>Satellites: Types of Orbit</u></h2>
<p>There are four primary types of orbit for satellites</p>
 <ol>
    <li>Low Earth Orbit</li>
    <li>Geosynchronous Earth Orbit</li>
    <li>Medium Earth Orbit</li>
    <li>Highly Elliptical Orbit</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>1. LEO (Low Earth Orbit)</h3>
<p>As LEOs circulate on a lower orbit, it is obvious that they exhibit a much shorter period (the typical duration of LEO periods are 95 to 120 minutes). Additionally, LEO systems try to ensure a high elevation for every spot on earth to provide a high quality communication link.
Each LEO satellite will only be visible from the earth for about ten minutes.
A further classification of LEOs into little LEOs with low bandwidth services (some 100 bit/s), big LEOs (some 1,000 bit/s) and broadband LEOs with plans reaching into the Mbits/s range can be found in Comparetto (1997).
LEO satellites are much closer to earth than GEO satellites, ranging from 500 to 1,500 km above the surface. LEO satellites do not stay in fixed position relative to the surface, and are only visible for 15 to 20 minutes each pass.</p><br>
 <h3>2. GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit)</h3>
<p>If a satellite should appear in fixed in the sky, it requires a period of 24 hours. Using the equation of distance earth and satellite, r = (g.r2 /2.r.f)2)1/3 and the period of 24 hours f = 1/24 h. the resulting distance is 35,786 km. the orbit must have an inclination of 0 degree.
Geostationary satellites have a distance of almost 36,000 km to the earth. Examples are almost all TV and radio broadcast satellites, any weather satellites and satellites operating as backbones for the telephone network.
Objects in GEO moves around the earth at the same speed as the earth rotates. This means geostationary satellites remain in the same position relative to the surface of earth.</p><br>
<h3>3. MEO (Medium Earth Orbit)</h3>
<p>A MEO satellite situates in orbit somewhere between 6,000 km to 20,000 km above the earth's surface.
MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in the context of functionality.
MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellite in functionality.
Medium earth orbit satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites usually between 2 to 8 hours.
MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than Low Earth Orbit satellites.
MEOs can be positioned somewhere between LEOs and GEOs, both in terms of their orbit and due to their advantages and disadvantages.</p><br>
<h3>4. HEO (High Earth Orbit)</h3>
<p>The High Earth orbit satellite is the only non-circular orbit of the four types.
HEO satellite operates with an elliptical orbit, with a maximum altitude (apogee) similar to GEO, and a minimum altitude (perigee) similar to the LEO.
The HEO satellites used for the special applications where coverage of high latitude locations is required.</p><br>
